We are a group of students, computer security enthusiasts and [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) players mostly from the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english). If you are interested in hacking with us, write us at [team@kitctf.de](mailto:team@kitctf.de) or come to our weekly meetings. We meet every Thursday at 7 pm in the computer science building (50.34), room -120 (sometimes in room -118).
Starting on the **25th of April**, we will be holding **introductory talks** for the main Capture the Flag categories to help new players get started. More details can be found [here](/intro).

We put a lot of love into [GPN CTF](https://ctf.kitctf.de/) this year. It is both a challenging event for experienced event CTF Teams, but also a good first CTF for everyone to get started. You can play online or in-person.
